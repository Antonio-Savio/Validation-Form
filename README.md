## What I learned 📖
- I needed to validate the e-mail field with the format of an actual e-mail address, so I learned what is RegEx and how to test it, then I could implement the validation.
- In order to avoid submitting the form when there's empty fields, or invalid info, I learned how to prevent default of submit button.
